# What is this?
A bash wrapper for the megacli tool from LSI to manage MegaRaid clusters.
The megacli-tool is notorious for being cryptic/hard to use[1].

There is also a new tool called storcli[2] which is much nicer to use, but still not as intuitive as it could be.

# Usage
Open the lsi.sh file and edit your settings (path and enclosure) for more info visit the post at the beginning of the readme.

```
[root@cluster ~]# ./lsi 

            OBPG  .:.  lsi.sh
